# print("*")

# Use a for loop and a while loop to print asterisks 1, 2, 3, .... 10 times sequentially. You can use string multiplication to get this done
# for num in range(1, 11):
#         print(f"*" * num) 

# reps = 1
# while reps <= 10:
#         print(f"*" *  reps)
#         reps += 1

# Nested loops
for x in range(3):
        for num in range(1, 11):
